          <div class="project-text">OYO is a great way to discover and book budget hotels in India. But I run into
            problems every now and then when I use their mobile app. I was curious whether other users faced similar
            problems, so I decided to put my UX hat on and interview people regarding their experience. Quick usability
            testing revealed some pain points in the mobile app. In this UX case study, I try to design solutions
            around these problems and validate them with some additional usability tests.</div>

          <div class="project-text">After better understanding the customer base, I set out to conduct guerilla
            usability tests at Mall of India and interviewed seven people.<br><br>This was the task that I had users
            complete:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Imagine you are travelling to a {random city} from 10 July to 13 July. You saw an advert about this
                hotel booking app called OYO earlier the day. How would you get about booking a place to stay with this
                app?</li>
              <li>You don’t have your credit card right now. You decide to save the hotels you like so you can get back
                to them later. How would you do that?</li>
              <li>You booked a room, but you realize that it’s far from the airport and you do not want the room
                anymore. Can you show me how you would fix this?</li>

            I recorded their screens while they were interacting the app. After the users completed the task, I noted

            colors represent different users while different groups represent different tasks. Notes stacked on each
            other imply multiple users experiencing the same problem. A question at the end indicates a question, not a

          <div class="project-text"><b>Pain Point #2: Filtering Hotels</b> <br><br> While filtering for hotels, number
            of available rooms would diminish to zero on some locations. when using filters. <br> <br>People booking
            these rooms prefer to have certain resources available during their stay such as AC, Wi-Fi, etc. and it is
            beneficial to provide a filter to select hotels providing these services. But almost every user experienced
            number of sorted hotels reducing down to zero when applying three or more of these filters, which reduced
            the efficiency of the booking process. Users eventually gave up and looked for hotels with these services
            manually. <br><br> <b>Pain Point #3: Viewing hotel’s distance from the airport</b> <br><br> 5/5 users
            stated distance to airport an important factor in choosing a hotel. 3/5 launched Google Maps to look up how
            far the hotel was from the nearest airport.

            belief, users were still struggling with finding nearby places on the map. <br><br>People got the general
            idea of the ‘nearby’ places and were able to scroll the list to lookup places. Once they found the place
            they were looking for, they tapped on the place waiting for something to happen. People wanted the map to
            provide directions in addition to the distance between the hotel and the airport. I decided to make the
