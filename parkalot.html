Due to the lack of parking it can effect our personal lives.  Parkalot is a P2P platform which allows users to rent out their driveways. The purpose is to secure a parking space ahead of time or instantaneously. No more stress, no more worrying, and no more being late. </div>

          <div class="project-text">After better understanding the customer base, I set out to conduct guerilla usability tests at Mall of India and interviewed seven people.<br><br>This was the task that I had users complete:<br>
          <ol>
            <li>Imagine you are travelling to a {random city} from 10 July to 13 July. You saw an advert about this hotel booking app called OYO earlier the day. How would you get about booking a place to stay with this app?</li>
            <li>You don’t have your credit card right now. You decide to save the hotels you like so you can get back to them later. How would you do that?</li>
            <li>You booked a room, but you realize that it’s far from the airport and you do not want the room anymore. Can you show me how you would fix this?</li>
          </ol> 
          I recorded their screens while they were interacting the app. After the users completed the task, I noted down their demographics.

          <div class="project-text-title">Affinity Mapping</div>
          <div class="project-text">After I had ample data to work on, I started analyzing the recordings. I jotted down all the problems that I noticed on sticky notes. I also noted all the questions that people were asking while completing the task. Next, I grouped all my insights to create a affinity map. Different colors represent different users while different groups represent different tasks. Notes stacked on each other imply multiple users experiencing the same problem. A question at the end indicates a question, not a pain point</div>

          <div class="project-text">In order to prioritize which issues to tackle, I jotted down the problems on a 2x2 matrix with the x-axis charting importance to the user and y-axis charting importance to OYO. Assuming decreasing the dropping off across the funnel was the most important</div>

          <div class="project-text">After affinity mapping, I decided to tackle all the pain points that were either most important to the user or OYO. <br><br> <b>Pain Point #1: Setting Dates</b> <br><br> While searching for hotels, 5/5 users would forgot to set their check-in and check-out date and start browsing hotels. On the final booking page, they would realize that the dates were wrong and start over.

          </div>
          <div class="project-text">Almost every user missed setting the date and started browsing hotels. This was not a particularly bad thing since you can change the dates after selecting a hotel. But most of the time users didn’t realize this and would go back a step to set dates

          <div class="project-text"><b>Pain Point #2: Filtering Hotels</b> <br><br> While filtering for hotels, number of available rooms would diminish to zero on some locations. when using filters. <br> <br>People booking these rooms prefer to have certain resources available during their stay such as AC, Wi-Fi, etc. and it is beneficial to provide a filter to select hotels providing these services. But almost every user experienced number of sorted hotels reducing down to zero when applying three or more of these filters, which reduced the efficiency of the booking process. Users eventually gave up and looked for hotels with these services manually. <br><br> <b>Pain Point #3: Viewing hotel’s distance from the airport</b> <br><br> 5/5 users stated distance to airport an important factor in choosing a hotel. 3/5 launched Google Maps to look up how far the hotel was from the nearest airport.

I received some good insights and incorporated them into the final design.

This step was often ignored because people directly started browsing the hotels. <br><br>After: Moved the calendar so that it appears right after the user selects a city.

              After crafting solutions to the pain points users were facing, it was time to validate them with a different set of users. I talked to 5 additional users and noted down their user flow. Contrary to my belief, users were still struggling with finding nearby places on the map. <br><br>People got the general idea of the ‘nearby’ places and were able to scroll the list to lookup places. Once they found the place they were looking for, they tapped on the place waiting for something to happen. People wanted the map to provide directions in addition to the distance between the hotel and the airport. I decided to make the list items clickable.
